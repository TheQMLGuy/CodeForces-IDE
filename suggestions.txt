make the variable thing live!
i should be able to see its values without needing to refresh
even if its input from the input panel, it should read it without me having to run the code manually and where is that
+ button where we havve quick actions panel like taking input (list, number, string, etc.)
---done---
remove that extra black area at right, and make the individual variable boxes smaller, so that more variables can fit in the screen
can fit in the view, and suggest more features so that it can be a versatile tool for codeforces
---done---
make the variables update more faster, if possible 10ms
and add dark/light theme toggle, complexity analyzer(a big yes), stress testing(please, it would work in unison with 
problem parser, making sure its the correct test case) and yeah the black screen we removed we can add the test case manager there
--done--
make the test case manager live, so that i can see the test cases without needing to refresh
dont make the test case manager, variable, and complexity thing in the same tab, move the test case and
complexity analyzer to right of variable box, making the complexity analyser below the test case, taking up square box space
--done--
make the complexity analyser live, so that i can see the complexity without needing to refresh
you dont need to mention sample 1, its already very clear that its sample 1 since its in a box, remove that
and please remove that empty black area at the rightmost
and shift complexity analyzer just a bit up making sure it fits in the view
--done--
there is still black empty space at the rightmost
--done--
the test case manager is taking a lot of horizontal space, do one thing, sandwich the complexity analyzer
between the variable box and test case manager
--done--
add time and space complexity of each line(no need to right O, just write if its n n^2 and so on) at the rightmost of the editor, that would be a cool feature isnt it?
and make them seperate by vertical lines
--done--
the test case manager is taking too much space, and the variable box is bit too small horizontally, expand it
--done-- 
where is space complexity of each line?
--done--
also at the top write t|s so that its clear which is which and make a nice line seperating these complexity and the editor
and make 1 as absolute green while going red as the complexity rises, with red for maximum complexity n!
and make the variable box a bit wider, shifting editor to a bit left and test case manager to a bit right
and why is 1 purple in there, and really widen the variable i aim to add more buttons to it
for the space too, use the same colour coding
--done-- fixed to show 0 | 0 | 0 format with three columns, and list input now shows n space
well we can remove the complexity block since we are doing it per line...
and clear up the ui for complexity its stacked up....
--done-- removed complexity panel, cleaned up UI
output is not working as intended
--done-- output verified working
remove that green dot between the top strip and the coding area above the add button
--done-- removed green save-status dot
the if else snippets idea(cursor auto moving as intended when space/enter button is clicked, seperate button for it)
like for example
if i type def and press space, it automatically write it as def (): and places the cursor before bracket to write the function name, and then next space will take me inside the bracket, and next space will take me to next line with indentation
also another example lets say i write l1 = [1,2,3] and press enter inside of 3, then instead of taking brackets to next line it takes the cursor keeping the bracket intact, and automa
also if i type in else and press enter it automatically adds colon and shifts the cursor to next line with indentation
so like things like this
--done-- smart snippets: def/if/else/for/while/class + space/enter auto-expands with cursor positioning
add convert button that allows converting from one datatype to another, where it will be a loop icon and clicking on it opens a dropdown where we can choose which datatype to convert to
--done-- added 🔄 convert button in Variables panel with dropdown (int, str, float, list, set, dict, tuple, bool)
also quick cursor action using alt
like if i enter 1 while pressing alt the cursor will go to 1st line without changing its horizontal position
if i enter 1e it takes me to the end of 1st line
--done-- Alt+number goes to line, Alt+number+e goes to end of line
and add option like snippets where i can add my own set of rules using alt
