make the variable thing live!
i should be able to see its values without needing to refresh
even if its input from the input panel, it should read it without me having to run the code manually and where is that
+ button where we havve quick actions panel like taking input (list, number, string, etc.)
---done---
remove that extra black area at right, and make the individual variable boxes smaller, so that more variables can fit in the screen
can fit in the view, and suggest more features so that it can be a versatile tool for codeforces
---done---
make the variables update more faster, if possible 10ms
and add dark/light theme toggle, complexity analyzer(a big yes), stress testing(please, it would work in unison with 
problem parser, making sure its the correct test case) and yeah the black screen we removed we can add the test case manager there
--done--
make the test case manager live, so that i can see the test cases without needing to refresh
dont make the test case manager, variable, and complexity thing in the same tab, move the test case and
complexity analyzer to right of variable box, making the complexity analyser below the test case, taking up square box space
--done--
make the complexity analyser live, so that i can see the complexity without needing to refresh
you dont need to mention sample 1, its already very clear that its sample 1 since its in a box, remove that
and please remove that empty black area at the rightmost
and shift complexity analyzer just a bit up making sure it fits in the view
--done--
there is still black empty space at the rightmost
--done--
the test case manager is taking a lot of horizontal space, do one thing, sandwich the complexity analyzer
between the variable box and test case manager
--done--
add time and space complexity of each line(no need to right O, just write if its n n^2 and so on) at the rightmost of the editor, that would be a cool feature isnt it?
and make them seperate by vertical lines
--done--
the test case manager is taking too much space, and the variable box is bit too small horizontally, expand it
--done-- 
where is space complexity of each line?
--done--
also at the top write t|s so that its clear which is which and make a nice line seperating these complexity and the editor
and make 1 as absolute green while going red as the complexity rises, with red for maximum complexity n!
and make the variable box a bit wider, shifting editor to a bit left and test case manager to a bit right
and why is 1 purple in there, and really widen the variable i aim to add more buttons to it
for the space too, use the same colour coding
